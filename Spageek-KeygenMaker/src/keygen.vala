/******************************************************************************

    This code is the very first try to make a real KeyGenMaker template, this
    is very simple for now:

    - A only main function.

    The idea is create a proces capable to make a Keygen in 3 steps:

    - Design the form in glade.
    - Code the algorithm in a simple GUI.
    - Make the Keygen only pressing a single button.

    The key in that process is make a good template to permit the parser
    understand all XML fields and fill all information correctly.

                                                            Enjoy & Hack'a'lot
